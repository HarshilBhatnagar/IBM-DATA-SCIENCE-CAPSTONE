<h1>Objective: This Project aims to forecast the likelihood of succesfull landings of SpaceX's Falcon-9 first stage.<h1/>

<h2>Key Achievements:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Achieved 76.9% success rate at the KSC LC-39A launch site, making it the most reliable site.</li>
  <li>Implemented a Decision Tree model, which proved to be the best-performing classification algorithm, demonstrating the highest accuracy in predicting landing outcomes.</li>
  <li>Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and built interactive visualizations, improving insights into launch performance and payload relationships.</li>
  <li>Automated data collection via SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia web scraping, covering over 150 Falcon-9 launches, reducing manual data gathering efforts by over 80%.</li>
</ul>

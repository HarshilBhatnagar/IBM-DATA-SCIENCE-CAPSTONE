Objective: This Project aims to forecast the likelihood of succesfull landings of SpaceX's Falcon-9 first stage.

Key Achievements:
Achieved 76.9% success rate at the KSC LC-39A launch site, making it the most reliable site.
Implemented a Decision Tree model, which proved to be the best-performing classification algorithm, demonstrating the highest accuracy in predicting landing outcomes.
Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and built interactive visualizations, improving insights into launch performance and payload relationships.
Automated data collection via SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia web scraping, covering over 150 Falcon-9 launches, reducing manual data gathering efforts by over 80%.
